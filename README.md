System Design and Business Requirements documents for DriverPass

  The DriverPass system was designed for the company DriverPass who had requested we design software for their business. The information in the business design document came directly from ana interview with DriverPass employees on what kind of system they wanted. The key part of the request was that the software was online and always available for anyone to access. It would be capable of handling the sale of driving instruction packages and the scheduling of appointments for customers,  while also having some additional functions only for the employees.
  
  The system design document was challenging because we had to make a lot of diagrams to show how we were building the system. My UML class diagram in particular worked extremely well and did a good job of outlining the code that will be in the system. With that UML diagram, we might have enough to sit down and code the entire system. I was able to show that the system could have objects to represent cars, instructors, admins, customers, packages, appointments, and a calendar. It also showed how they would be interacting with each other.
  
  One place that needs to be re-worked is the busisness requirements docuement. It's got a ton of bullet points that could be combined into more coherent ideas. The current format is a bit messy and it needs to be re-worked and edited to look more professional. In it's current state I would not present it to the customer.
  
  The way that I interpreted the users needs was by reading the interview transcripts closely, and itemizing each request the employees had of the software. They presented several use cases during the interview, and I grouped them all together on a diagram. This diagram is on the system design document, and does a good job of showing what the customer was looking for out of their software. The rest of that document shows how we will accomplish each of those use cases in order to satisfy the customer. If you're not careful to consider the customer's needs when designing your system, you will likely end up with something that doesn't accomplish what your customer was looking for.
  
  The best way to approach designing software is to carefully document their needs. From there, creating business requirements and system design documents are a great next step. I would use the same techniques that we learned here in this class and that I used to create those documents. I make sure to try to be as thorough as possible and account for anything that might need to be included in the design. It's important to stay focused on what the customer wants, and look for ways you can help improve their workflow.
